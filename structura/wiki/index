#Welcome to /r/btc!

Bitcoin, commonly abbreviated as BTC, is the [currency of the Internet](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Introduction). It is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the [blockchain](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Blockchain), which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.

The /r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin, but quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin [block size](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=block+size&restrict_sr=on) debate heightened. On the legacy \/r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions. 

Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which lead to](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) many hundreds of redditors being banned from the \/r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc. For a full run-down on the history of censorship, please read *[A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)* by John Blocke. 

**This subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. /r/btc honors the spirit and nature of bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://r.go1dfish.me/r/btc/about/log#?theme=btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own**

#The benefits of Bitcoin

* Bitcoin is permissionless: Traditional currencies require permission to use (from banks, financial institutions, governments). Bitcoin requires no permission from anyone and is free and open to use globally. 

* Bitcoin is immune to seizure: Nobody can steal or confiscate your bitcoin since you own it; it's not housed at any bank or company. 

* Bitcoin is censorship resistant: Using [proof-of-work](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Proof_of_work) (PoW), no one can block or censor your transactions. 

* Bitcoin is decentralized: The network is distributed globally among many [thousands of nodes](https://bitnodes.21.co/) and [millions of users](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Introduction#How_many_people_use_Bitcoin.3F).

* Bitcoin has a limited supply: There will only ever be [21 million bitcoins](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/FAQ#How_long_will_it_take_to_generate_all_the_coins.3F) created and are generated at a predictable rate; bitcoin is deflationary. 

* Bitcoin is open source: anyone can contribute to developing bitcoin in a myriad of areas including different [bitcoin clients](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Software#Bitcoin_clients). 

* Bitcoin is fast and easy: since bitcoin is a digital currency, transactions are near instant and are very low-cost (much less than central payment networks such as PayPal). 

* Bitcoin is a "push system": With bitcoin, there is no risk of charge-backs because once bitcoins are sent, the transaction cannot be reversed. Bitcoin is very similar to cash in this sense; once you give someone cash, you cannot get it back (unless they give it back to you). 

* Bitcoin is freedom: using bitcoin gives you the financial freedom to transact globally using the properties mentioned above.
