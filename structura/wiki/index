#Welcome to /r/btc!

Bitcoin, commonly abbreviated as BTC, is the [currency of the Internet](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Introduction). It is a global and decentralized digital money, that also powers the blockchain, which is an immutable ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever.

The /r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin, but quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin [block size](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=block+size&restrict_sr=on) debate heightened. On the legacy /r/bitcoin subreddit the lead moderator along with several other moderators were found to have been heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with the opinions of the lead moderator. 

Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which lead to](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) hundreds if not thousands of redditors being banned from the /r/bitcoin subreddit. Many switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc.

/r/btc honors the spirit and nature of bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://r.go1dfish.me/r/btc/about/log#?theme=btc).
